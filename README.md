# Welcome to Tveeter

> An open-source chat application built with React, NestJS, and Socket.io.

This is a project I built to learn more about how React, NestJS, and Socket.io work together.

## Directories

-   `web`: React using Next for routing (frontend)
-   `api`: NestJS & Socket.io for api management and websockets (backend)

## Running the app

If you'd like to run the app locally, you'll need to have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed.

To run the frontend you can use the following commands:

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

and for the backend:

```bash
cd api
pnpm install
pnpm start:dev
```
